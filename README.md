This is a demo project that was created for a [YouTube live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqJaWS7BHcE).

In this stream, I wanted to teach a little lesson on React. A few of the concepts that were covered in this project are:

- Using Chakra UI to bootstrap a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)] project
- Using React hooks and state management
- Creating custom hooks
- Fetching data from an API and rendering it to the screen
